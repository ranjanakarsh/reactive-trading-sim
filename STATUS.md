# Reactive Trading Simulator - Project Status

## Fixed Issues

1. **Type Mismatch Errors**
   - Fixed type errors in `order_book.ml` (order vs. trade confusion)
   - Added type annotations to clarify data structures
   - Fixed warnings about unused variables and open statements

2. **Test Suite**
   - Unit tests now pass without errors
   - Improved test structure and organization

## Current Status

1. **Unit Tests**
   - All unit tests pass successfully
   - Both `test_order_book.ml` and `test_agents.ml` unit tests function correctly

2. **Main Simulation**
   - Simulation runs without errors
   - Correctly simulates a market with multiple agent types
   - Order book maintains proper bid/ask spread

## Remaining Issues

1. **Property-based Tests**
   - Property-based tests in `test_order_book.ml` are currently disabled
   - There appear to be type compatibility issues between the QCheck2 generators and the order book implementation
   - Specific error: Confusion between `order list` and `trade list` types in property tests

## Next Steps

1. **Property Test Repair**
   - Create dedicated test file with proper QCheck2 integration
   - Define correctly typed generators and property tests
   - Incrementally reimplement each property test

2. **Code Quality**
   - Add more documentation and comments
   - Consider adding more realistic agent strategies
   - Enhance error handling and validation

## Conclusion

The core simulation is working correctly, and the basic test suite passes. The property-based tests need further work to resolve type compatibility issues, but this does not affect the functionality of the main simulation.
